## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Unable to use external sheets
- Stop button

## :sob: Lessons learnt
What I would do differently if I could wind back the clock...
- Create a strong plan and break down the alogrithm into small bits or pseudocode
- Time Mangement and spend more time on the css

## :white_check_mark: Future features
Cool things I would add if I can keep working on this
- Local Storage
- Bot Vs Human
